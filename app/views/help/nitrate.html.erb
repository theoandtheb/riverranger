    <p>Nitrogen compounds dissolved in water are an important class of plant nutrients. Natural levels of nitrates may also be supplemented by runoff from nitrate fertilizers used in agriculture. The dominant form of nitrogen present in water is dependent on the level of dissolved oxygen present. Excessive levels of nitrogen may also cause eutrophication (excessive plant growth), a process which can lead to zones with low oxygen content.</p>

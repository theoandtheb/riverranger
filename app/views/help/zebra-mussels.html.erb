    <p>Native to the Baltic, these invasive mussels made their way into the Great Lakes in the late 1980â€™s, probably in the ballast water of ships traveling the St. Laurence Seaway. They are mobile in their juvenile veliger form, before they build their shells; thick encrustations of zebra mussels may clog water intake pipes and out-compete native varieties of mussel. While still relatively uncommon within the Ottawa River Watershed, River Rangers should keep an eye out for these invasive organisms.</p>
